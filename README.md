Proposal

Idea 1: Spotify + Weather App
Our first idea was to combine the Spotify API with one of a weather application. This app will allow a user to log in with their Spotify account and using their preexisting Spotify listening data, the app will suggest the user a playlist based on the weather report. It will also give the weather report for the day. The playlist will be chosen based on the genre of the music that 1) most accuratley fits the mood of the weather and 2) is a genre that the user listens to often.

Idea 2: Spotify + Ticketmaster
Our second idea combines the Spotify API with the Ticketmaster API. This app will use a user's Spotify data and suggest tours or events near them. If one of their most listened to artist was touring, this app will notify the user. It will also suggest events by artists similar to the user's top artists. The user will also have the option of changing the location to see events in different areas (a feature of Ticketmaster).
